        Available for Qualified Purchasers only. Qualified Purchasers receive an
        Apple Gift Card when they purchase an Eligible Product at a Qualifying
        Location through September 30, 2024. Gift card values may vary by
        Eligible Product. Only one Apple Gift Card per Eligible Product per
        Qualified Purchaser. Offer subject to availability. While supplies last.
        Qualified Purchasers shall receive a discount equal to the value of the
        Apple Gift Card off the price of the Eligible Product, but will be
        charged for all items in their cart, including the Apple Gift Card.
        Important notice regarding the checkout receipt and monthly statement
        for Apple Card Monthly Installments (ACMI) purchases with this
        promotion: Qualified Purchasers selecting ACMI (a 0% APR payment option
        available only in the U.S.) as payment type at checkout shall receive a
        discount equal to the value of the Apple Gift Card off the price of the
        Eligible Product. <br><br> This will result in one ACMI installment plan over 12
        months for the Eligible Product discounted by the instant credit, and a
        second ACMI installment plan over 12 months for the full price of the
        Apple Gift Card. The total combined amount charged over the two separate
        ACMI installment plans will reflect the original full retail price of
        the Eligible Product. <br>Separately, Qualified Purchasers will receive and
        be charged for the Apple Gift Card in the amount of the applicable
        discount off the Eligible Product. Apple Card Monthly Installments
        (ACMI) is a 0% APR payment option that is only available if you select
        it at checkout in the U.S. for eligible products purchased at Apple
        Store locations, apple.com, the Apple Store app, or by calling
        1-800-MY-APPLE, and is subject to credit approval and credit limit. See
        support.apple.com/kb/HT211204 for more information about eligible
        products. APR ranges may vary based on when you accepted an Apple Card.
        Cardholders who accept an Apple Card on and or after February 1, 2024:
        Variable APRs for Apple Card, other than ACMI, range from 19.24% to
        29.49% based on creditworthiness. <br> Rates as of February 1, 2024. Existing
        cardholders: See your Customer Agreement for applicable rates and fee.
        If you buy an ACMI-eligible product by choosing to pay in full with
        Apple Card (instead of using ACMI), that purchase is subject to the
        Apple Card variable APR, not 0% APR. Taxes and shipping on ACMI
        purchases are subject to the variable APR, not 0% APR. When you buy an
        iPhone with ACMI, you’ll need to select AT&T, T-Mobile, or Verizon as
        your carrier when you check out. An iPhone purchased with ACMI is always
        unlocked, so you can switch carriers at any time. <br><br> ACMI is not available
        for purchases made online at the following special stores: Apple
        Employee Purchase Plan; participating corporate Employee Purchase
        Programs; Apple at Work for small businesses; Government and Veterans
        and Military Purchase Programs; or on refurbished devices. The last
        month's payment for each product will be the product’s purchase price,
        less all other payments at the monthly payment amount. ACMI financing is
        subject to change at any time for any reason, including but not limited
        to installment term lengths and eligible products. See
        support.apple.com/kb/HT211204 for information about upcoming changes to
        ACMI financing. See the Apple Card Customer Agreement for more
        information about ACMI financing. Apple Card is issued by Goldman Sachs
